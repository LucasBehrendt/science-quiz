## User Experience (UX) 
### Site Owner Goals

- Provide an entertaining and challenging quiz game that users enjoy.
- Present a well designed, structured website with clear purpose and navigation.
- Leave the user with a sense of accomplishment and some new knowledge.

### User Goals

- Understand the purpose of the game instantly.
- Have a positive feeling from the design and structure of the website.
- Test my knowledge in a fun and reasonably time consuming game.
- Easily navigate the site and be able to choose different difficulty levels.
- Receive feedback on my score and be able to easily play again.

### Structure

The structure of the website is designed to be simple, but professional looking. Users should be able to intuitively navigate the site with the burger icon, and all sections of the site are easily accessible. Users are greeted on the home page with a quick way to start the quiz, or the option to navigate the menu. From the menu the user can either select a difficulty setting, visit the "How To Play" page, or go back to the home page. The quiz game is structured in a logical and recognizable way. Feedback is given on all user interactions, such as navigating the menu, hovering over buttons, or answering quiz questions, to keep the user engaged. When all questions are answered, the user is presented with the result. A message that reflects the score is displayed, and a "Play Again" button takes the user back to the home page.

### Design
- #### Colours

  The colour scheme chosen for the website was generated with [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), by creating a palette from the background image. This makes for an inviting and aesthetically pleasing website which adds to the overall experience of the game. The font colour throughout the game is a near white colour (#FBFEFF) that provides good contrast with both the background colour of the game section (#021025) and the buttons background colour (#708298). 

- #### Typography

  The font used is Dongle Regular for all content in the site. After careful consideration, and many tests with other fonts, Dongle Regular works best with the content and feel of the game itself. If for some reason the font isn't imported correctly, Sans-serif will serve as fallback.

- #### Imagery

  The background image of the website, which is the only image in the site, was chosen to convey a scientific theme and to be visually striking. The image is an artistic representation of a DNA spiral structure against a dark blue background. As mentioned above, the colour palette was generated from this image. This guarantees that all colours work very well together.

## Features

In the following section I will provide an overview of the features on Science Quiz. The site consists of a single page with multiple sections, which are visible one at a time. The background image is visible throughout all pages, and the quiz game in the middle of the site holds all the different sections. All features have been made responsive across all devices. 

### Home Page

- The home page consists of a title that instantly shows the user the purpose of the site, and a message to clarify the next step to be taken by the user. There is a button at the bottom of the section labelled "Start Quiz" which if clicked, starts the quiz in the default easy mode, as stated by the message above the button. This page is designed to be inviting and simple, with a quick and easy path into the quiz itself.

- On smaller screen sizes the layout remains the same, and the text elements are adapted to fit the section in a pleasing way. The button at the bottom is reduced in height to improve the layout.
